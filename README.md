# Klipper_UserInteraction
A set of macros to enable print-time user interaction with Klipper via Console and UI buttons (macros).

19MAR23 Update: Added default 'Text Decorations' to the queries.  Updated code herein with the latest from my
production printer environment.  Added verbal hinting/reminding with TTS macro calls: say & say_wait

Note that the files herein may not be the latest - 'production' code is attainable via my printer config:
https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_user_interaction.cfg and
https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_ui_test.cfg

Here is an example of a real world use case - optionally keeping heaters on & unloading filament @ print end:

Other cases in which I employ this module in my daily printing work-flow:
- At print start, if extrusion factor or speed factor is not 100%, go interactive to give user option to reset each to 100% before commencing the print:

- At print canx/end, give user opportunity to retain heater settings, or to turn heaters off;
- At print canx/end, give user option to retain or unload filament (12-color Multi-Material ERCF here);
- At print end, give user opportunity to push current configs up to github repo, for historization and disaster recovery purposes:
	- The '_git_repo_ops' macro set has been enhanced to query the user for a 1-72 character commit summary message

- During calibration of ERCF Filament Encoder, for each color/cart, give user ability to restart the calibration or to accept same and continue
- Used UI module during testing of various hardware items (i.e. servo throw angle determinations for v0.1 nozzle scrubber and side swipe Klicky/Euclid bed probes)
- ... more that I cannot recall right now

## USER-SUBMITTED USE CASES:

Here is a user-submitted example of using this macro library to implement an interactive M600 Filament Change process:

Thanks to Discord User Beatzoid#8010 for providing this fine example.

## PREREQUISITES:

Heavily relies on `[Save_Variables]` module
see: https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_persistent_variables.cfg

Makes use of **`M300`** and some custom **`M300_`** related macros I mucked with for emitting sounds, so if you're not so
interested, or haven't a beeper on your box, comment out related lines: `_ui_reminder`, `_annunciate_input_exception`,
and `_annunciate_good_input` - see: https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_m300_sounds.cfg

Makes heavy use of the **`[response]`** module - I've trapped the stock M118 (using rename_existing) with gcode such
that it uses action_notification vs. FW M118 code.  This enables emission of 'special characters' that M118's
FW code chokes on - see: https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_gcode_macros.cfg

Throughout my configs, virtually all gcode macros have been 'instrumented' - the first and last lines of each gcode block can be deleted.
I have these as I have an ability to trace macro code execution and display same in the console - quite powerful for macro development/
troubleshooting but of little/no use to others, with rare exception - 
see: https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_trace_debug.cfg

Users should consider adding a User Input macro pane, as depicted below - which calls macros herein.  
Orienting it under the console pane will allow it to become intuitive with a small bit of use.  Author's UI of choice is Mainsail.  

For Fluidd or other Moonraker Clients (Mooncord/Telegram Bot/...), author defers to others to adapt the macros for use therein.
If same is ever accomplished, author request that he be advised of same, to allow inclusion of same being as an element to this readme.

## Primary Macro:  GET_USER_INPUT  Parameters and related dialog follows

One can interact directly with the module by simply calling ```get_user_input``` in the console with no parameters.  

In this case all of the default parameters come into play.  It allows for a quick painless test to see if it is working or not.

However, that is only the tip of the iceberg. The real power in this UI macro 'module' is the ability to query for specific types of 
input (strings, floats, and integers), assign bounds to the received user input and requery or error out on out of bounds input, 
provide customized input prompts, provide hinting at either input prompt presentation, or if an out of bounds (/latent) response
is (isn't) received, to enable periodic aural reminders (both beeper/buzzer if so equipped, and/or with TTS (if a TTS module
exists)), to have customized exception handler macros (if the stock ones aren't to one's liking), to direct received input to a
any user macro/klipper FW module, to have default responses generated and utilized in the event a user either neglects to provide
a timely response or elects to select a default response, and to read-back user responses or enunciate which button stroke was 
detected (which may be useful for those that need same (i.e. for accessibility reasons).

Optional Parameters:

**`PROMPT`**		Quoted Text to display in console as a user input prompt.  Prompts are visually separated from balance
of console context via a dashed line being displayed before and after the prompt (see images below).

**`RCVR_MACRO`**	Macro name to run when VALID input received - UI_INPUT param, containing user input contents is 
passed to the called macro - if required, the called user macro can query svv for additional details.

**`TYPE`**		The TYPE of input needed - one of these three string/str, integer/int, float/flt

**`BOUNDS_HI`**	if TYPE is float/flt, input must be >=lo and <=hi - for integer/int, input must be >=floor(lo) and <=ceiling(hi)

**`BOUNDS_LO`**	 - if string/str TYPE, character count must be >=floor(lo) and <=ceiling(hi)

**`TO_PERIOD`**		Period in Integer seconds to wait for user input

**`RMDR_PERIOD`**	Overrides the default reminder period set in \_ui_vars while waiting for user input

**`EXCPT_HDLR`**	Macro name is called in the event of an input timeout or faulty input - no params passed - query svv...

**`TO_CYCL_DEF`**	iterations of timeouts before TO_RESP_DEF is sent as UI_INPUT to RCVR_MACRO - default: -1 to disable behavior

**`TO_RESP_DEF`**	UI_INPUT value to be passed if TO_CYCL_DEF count reaches 0 when decremented @ timeout

For string TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_LO`** is not asserted, defaults to 1.

For string TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_HI`** is not asserted, defaults to 255.

For float TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_LO`** is not asserted, defaults to -999999999.0.

For float TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_HI`** is not asserted, defaults to 999999999.0.

For integer TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_LO`** is not asserted, defaults to -999999999.

For integer TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_HI`** is not asserted, defaults to 999999999

If additional bounds testing is desired/required, it's up to the user implementing this on their printers to craft more granular
test and validation - by way of the **`RCVR_MACRO`**.  If I've blatantly missed something, then let me know. :)

For optional parameters, read the code to understand implications of relying on defaults.

Again, ALL parameters are optional and default to something (depicted in the following):

	`PROMPT="Awaiting User Input:"		displayed on the console at macro start as a user prompt
	TYPE=STRING				'string'('str') or 'integer'('int') or 'float'('flt') - for buttons use string
	BOUNDS_LO=1				min string chars or min numerical value (Int/Flt -999999999)
	BOUNDS_HI=255				max string chars or max numerical value (Int/Flt  999999999)
	RCVR_MACRO="_test_show_user_input"	to accept param UI_INPUT that will be an int/flt/"string" that was 
						input and passes sniff test (simple bounding checks)
	TO_PERIOD=120				in seconds
	EXCPT_HDLR="_ui_exception_handler"	no params passed to this proc - use svv to get runtime specifics if needed
	TO_CYCL_DEF=-1				
	TO_RESP_DEF="NULL"			if TO_CYCLES >=0, this param will be passed to RCVR_MACRO via UI_INPUT if no user input received
	RMDR_PERIOD=15				reminder bleeps every n seconds - 0 will disable reminder beeps`

Also, there are six other module macro variables that affect the function of the macros

	`variable_ui_input_check_recurse_period:	  0.5	# seconds - period between checking for input when expected - 0.5s is good - less leads to more host
								# cycle consumption, larger leads to reduced perceived responsiveness
	variable_ui_reminder_enable:		  1	# bool 1/0 - 0 overtly disables reminder bleeps regardless of RMDR_PERIOD param
	variable_ui_enable_input_hints:		  0	# bool 1/0 - defaults to disabling hints on input prompt
	variable_ui_disable_exception_hints:  0	# bool 1/0 - defaults to enabling hints on an exception event
	
	# if a TTS module is installed and operable, these can become salient wrt the employment of this module in user Klipper macros:
	variable_ui_input_readback_flag:	  0	#bool 1/0 - 1 enabled read-back of user input value - overly chatty, but helpful for peeps with accessibility issues, maybe?
	variable_ui_button_readback_flag:	  0	#bool 1/0 - 1 enabled read-back of user UI button click - overly chatty, but helpful for peeps with accessibility issues, maybe?`

	These can be programmatically altered during runtime via use of SET_GCODE_VARIABLE gcode command - i.e.:

		SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=_ui_vars VARIABLE=ui_enable_input_hints VALUE=1

### Example call follows:
This call looks for a user to enter a string 1-12 chars long, with a timeout of 60 secs, that forwards (via UI_INPUT param),
the entered string to the '_test_show_user_input' macro (default if no RCVR_MACRO passed by user call)
If a timeout happens/faulty input is detected, the _ui_timeout_watchdog/_validate_user_input macros call '_ui_exception_handler' macro
(which is the default exception handler if no EXCPT_HDLR macro name is passed by the user call)

`get_user_input` `PROMPT="Enter/click something:"` `TYPE=string` `BOUNDS_LO=1` `BOUNDS_HI=12` `RCVR_MACRO=_test_show_user_input` `TO_PERIOD=60` `EXCPT_HDLR=_ui_exception_handler`

## EXCEPTION HANDLER MACRO:
if a custom **`EXCPT_HDLR`** macro is to be instantiated, it may prove useful to consider the following:
 - **`GET_USER_INPUT`** does the following:
   - initializes states and then displays the user **`PROMPT`**
   - sets the timeout watchdog to fire after the asserted (120s default) **`TO_PERIOD`**
   - puts **`_await_user_input`** into a recursive loop, non-blocking while waiting, with a period defined in _ui_vars
 - a single **`EXCPT_HDLR`** macro services both bad input cases as well as the time-out when waiting on user input.
 - for timeouts the **default** **`EXCPT_HDLR`** macro simply recalls **`GET_USER_INPUT`** giving user another input context
   - this approach can be altered with a custom **`EXCPT_HDLR`** macro being passed to the **`GET_USER_INPUT`** call
 - When `_await_user_input` detects input from user, `_validate_user_input` tests for **`TYPE`** and **`BOUNDS_HI`**/**`BOUNDS_LO`** compliance
   - if input is NOT **`TYPE`** & **`BOUNDS_HI`**/**`BOUNDS_LO`** compliant, `_await_user_input` recalls **`GET_USER_INPUT`** so user can fix it
   - if input IS **`TYPE`** & **`BOUNDS_HI`**/**`BOUNDS_LO`** compliant (flag `_ui_bad_input` NOT set), input is sent to **`RCVR_MACRO`** via **`UI_INPUT`** param

In most conceivable use cases, the default exception handler/validation macros should be adequate.  However, author decided to give others
options, in the event something wasn't adequately considered.  Either an entirely new **`EXCPT_HDLR`** can be crafted or, as demonstrated
in _ui_test.cfg's `_ui_test_exception_handler` (custom **`EXCPT_HDLR`**) code runs and then chains to the stock `_ui_exception_handler` below

In `_ui_vars` macro, a person implementing this can selectively enable/disable Input Prompt and/or Exception hints.  Hints are
little descriptive blurbs as to what the macro is expecting as input - one can enable hints on either the input prompt,
or disable hints when an input exception is detected/raised.  It is suggested that it is likely best to have exception
hints enabled, and to have the input prompt detail what sort of input is desired, leaving input hints disabled.
The `_ui_test.cfg` file has the START_DEMO macro that iterates through some UI input event - I used it for dev testing,
it works as a demo.

## Some visual examples as it relates to the hint options that can be set in `_ui_vars`:

No Hints on Exception nor Input Prompt: https://i.imgur.com/PDPOmTJ.png (likely too terse - user should make the preamble/prompt detailed)

![https://i.imgur.com/PDPOmTJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/PDPOmTJ.png)

Hints on Exception only, not on Input Prompt:  https://i.imgur.com/D5Ih6hE.png (the author's preference)

![https://i.imgur.com/D5Ih6hE.png](https://i.imgur.com/D5Ih6hE.png)

Hints on Input Prompt but not on an Exception:  https://i.imgur.com/Deo2SNr.png (leads to some noise, which may be tolerable)

![https://i.imgur.com/Deo2SNr.png](https://i.imgur.com/Deo2SNr.png)

Hints on both Input Prompt and when an exception is raised:  https://i.imgur.com/mO7TfWW.png (likely redundant, imo)
